# concept-game-we-dont-have-a-name-yet-
ok so  im tryin to create a fangame for batim/batdr, it is going to be at the most a what if/au sorta thing. it is a horror/survival game, where we will have to do tasks which will not  only further gameplay but will help us move on with. the idea is to try and make it a multi-ending game. we are good progress on it and have most of chapter.1 for it mapped out.
our team is small, were a group of five and we compose of artists and writers.

the story is still in planning but we also have some gameplay ideas and character ideas set in motion.
if you would to see what weve done so far please the file below.
